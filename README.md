## The Experience / Learning Outcomes
React.js was an overwhelming and challenging experience to me as I was introduced to it at the same time I just started learning JavaScript. It helped me stretch my brain and practice how to think and process data like a computer would. It was like exploring a whole new world that's strange and scary, but curious and interesting at the same time. During the process, I was able to pick up and grasp the concept of React more and I can say I am fairly happy and proud of how my project turned out.

To be honest, there is still so much to learn and comprehend about React but I'm grateful that this project has already given me an overview/structure of said library, and to be armed with that knowledge is so helpful as I continue delving more into that world.
