###The Experience / Learning Outcomes
React.js was an overwhelming and challenging experience to me as I was introduced to it at the same time I just started learning JavaScript. This lesson helped me stretch my brain and practice how to think and process data like a computer would. It was like exploring a whole new world that's strange and scary, but curious and interesting at the same time. I was able to pick up and grasp more about the concept of React during the creation of this quiz and I can say that I am fairly happy and proud of how this project turned out.

To be honest, there is still so much to learn and comprehend about React but I'm grateful that this lesson has already given me an overview/structure of the said library, and to be armed with that knowledge is very helpful as I continue delving more into it.
